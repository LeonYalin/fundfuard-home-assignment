# FundGuard Home Assignment

The FundGuard Home Assignment is a simple web application built with Create React App and TypeScript. The app draws a circle on the screen and provides various controls to interact with the circle. The assignment focuses on implementing the missing functionality and adhering to best coding practices.

## Functionality

The app consists of the following main features:

1. Drawing a Circle: The app displays a circle on the screen with initial position and size.

2. Control Buttons: There are four directional buttons (Up, Down, Left, Right) that allow users to move the circle in the appropriate directions. Additionally, there is a "Reset" button to reset the circle to its initial position and a "Randomize" button to set the circle's position to a random location.

## Getting Started

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.

2. Install the project dependencies using: `npm install`

3. Start the development server: `npm start`

The app should open in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000.

## Testing

The project includes unit tests for components and utility functions to ensure the code works as expected. The tests are implemented using Jest and React Testing Library. To run the tests, use the following command:

```
npm test
```
